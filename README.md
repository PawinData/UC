Modeling Temporal-Spatial Correlations for COVID-19 Prediction

This is the course project for Urban Computing (Spring 2020) at LIACS, Leiden University. We apply the TCP framework, originally proposed to predict urban crime, to forecast the number of new COVID-19 confirmed cases per one million population for each county in the San Francisco Bay Area every day and show that **TCP** often outperforms the baseline, that is, the Space-Time Auto-Regression (**STAR**) model, although STAR is more robust and computationally convenient in most simulations. This project has been added to [CoronaWhy Data Lake](https://www.coronawhy.org/), a globally-distributed, volunteer-powered research organization trying to assist the medical community to answer key questions related to COVID-19.
